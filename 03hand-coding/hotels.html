        <h2>Resort Hopping</h2>
        <p>When planning a trip to Disney World, most people just think about the parks. But the resorts have so much to
            offer! Planning a day to explore the resorts is a great idea and is so fun! You can take the monorail loop,
            to see the Grand Floridian, the Polynesian, and Contemporary Resorts. You can also take the skyliner resort
            to see the Riviera, Art of Animation, Carribean Beach, and Pop Century Resorts. It is important to keep in
            mind that there is no bus transportation between resorts. If you are trying to get to a resort, you need to
            fist take a bus to a park, the TTC, or Disney Springs.</p>
