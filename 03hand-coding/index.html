        <h1>Basic Info</h1>
        <p>Hi Iâ€™m Paisley! I am a huge Disney fan, and I used to be a Walt Disney World Cast Member! I lived and worked
            at Disney World for almost a year as part of the Disney College Program, and I was in the parks nearly every
            day. I am so passionate about using my deep knowledge to help people plan their perfect trip!</p>
        <h2>Terms to Know</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                <h3>My Disney Experience App</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>This is the app that you will need to navigate your entire trip. This is where you can view wait times
                for rides, show times, characters, and make mobile orders. </dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Moblie Ordering</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>At most Quick Service Restaurants there will be an option for mobile ordering. You will choose a pickup
                time, and place your order. Then when it is your pickup time and you are at the restaurant, you push
                "prepare my order", and it will send your order to the kitchen. When the order is ready, it will tell
                you where to pick it up. This is often much faster than waiting in line, and you can place your order
                hours in advance, or place it as soon as you're ready to eat. When placing a mobile order, there are
                often fewer options to modify certain food items.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Quick Service Dining</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>These are the "fast food" restaurants of Disney. They often have mobile ordering, and low wait times.
                Perfect for a quick, easy, cheap meal. </dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Table Service Dining</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>Table Service Restaurants are going to be a little more expensive, and take more time. You need a
                reservation as well. Reservations can be made 60 days in advance, but for some you could get a
                reservation day of. Most also have walk-up availability, depending on how busy the restaurant is. The
                food will be served either family style, buffet style, or a la carte.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Character Dining</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>Charcater Dining is just a Table Service Restaurant, just with character meet and greets. They will be
                more expensive, but they are so magical. They usually take a lot longer, as you have to wait for each
                individual charcater to come to your table.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Disney Springs</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>Disney Springs is the shopping center at Walt Disney World. It has many options for shopping, dining,
                and entertainment. </dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Rope Drop</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>Rope Dropping is when you get to the parks early, and wait behind a "rope" before the park opens. When
                the park opens they "drop the rope" and let you into the park, where everyone rushes to a ride. This is
                a good strategy to ride the busiest rides with the lowest wait times. Depending on how early you get to
                the park, a ride that is usually a 90 minute wait durring the day could be a walk on.</dd>
            <dt>
            <dt>
                <h3>Early Entry</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>If you are staying at an on property resort, you can get into the parks 30 minutes before it officially
                opens. If you plan right you could get a few rides done before everyone else comes in for rope drop. It
                is good to get there about 30-60 minutes before early entry starts if you want to have some walk on
                rides.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>TTC</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>This is the Ticket and Transportation Center. This is where you will park if you are going to Magic
                Kingdom. If you are taking the monorail to EPCOT you will have to get off here and transfer to the EPCOT
                monorail. It links the monorail resorts, Wilderness Lodge, Magic Kingdom, and EPCOT.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Buying Tickets</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>You can purchase tickets through a travel agency, or through Disney's Website. <a
                    href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/admission/tickets/?ef_id=Cj0KCQjwoP_FBhDFARIsANPG24Mbv-fsDv4Pp1s6CPdI2myqk5CL8PRI9OU6ofGdyO0EL31lWB2YaJQaAmU_EALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!5060!3!607595665907!b!!g!!disney%203%20day%20tickets&CMP=KNC-FY25_WDW_TRA_DXF_W365_TKT_TCKC_Tickets_Days|G|5251213.RR.AM.01.01|MMKX4NM|BR|607595665907&keyword_id=kwd-298503545214|dc|disney%203%20day%20tickets|607595665907|b|5060:3|&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=1584425161&gbraid=0AAAAAD_M-kYQcIfi-Iiss0zL1HlGcabSa&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoP_FBhDFARIsANPG24Mbv-fsDv4Pp1s6CPdI2myqk5CL8PRI9OU6ofGdyO0EL31lWB2YaJQaAmU_EALw_wcB"

            <dt>
                <h3>Lightning Lanes</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>I think Lightning Lanes are a waste of money, just because it is pretty easy to get everything done that
                you want in a day if you plan it right. So I will not be talking about them here.</dd>
