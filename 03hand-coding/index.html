        <h1>Basic Info</h1>
        <p>Hi Iâ€™m Paisley! I am a huge Disney fan, and I used to be a Walt Disney World Cast Member! I lived and worked
            at Disney World for almost a year as part of the Disney College Program, and I was in the parks nearly every
            day. I am so passionate about using my deep knowledge to help people plan their perfect trip!</p>
        <h2>Terms to Know</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                <h3>My Disney Experience App</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>This is the app that you will need to navigate your entire trip. This is where you can view wait times
                for rides, show times, characters, and make mobile orders. </dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Moblie Ordering</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>At most Quick Service Restaurants there will be an option for mobile ordering. You will choose a pickup
                time, and place your order. Then when it is your pickup time and you are at the restaurant, you push
                "prepare my order", and it will send your order to the kitchen. When the order is ready, it will tell
                you where to pick it up. This is often much faster than waiting in line, and you can place your order
                hours in advance, or place it as soon as you're ready to eat. When placing a mobile order, there are
                often fewer options to modify certain food items.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Quick Service Dining</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>These are the "fast food" restaurants of Disney. They often have mobile ordering, and low wait times.
                Perfect for a quick, easy, cheap meal. </dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Table Service Dining</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>Table Service Restaurants are going to be a little more expensive, and take more time. You need a
                reservation as well. Reservations can be made 60 days in advance, but for some you could get a
                reservation day of. Most also have walk-up availability, depending on how busy the restaurant is. The
                food will be served either family style, buffet style, or a la carte.</dd>
            <dt>
                <h3>Character Dining</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>Charcater Dining is just a Table Service Restaurant, just with character meet and greets. They will be
                more expensive, but they are so magical. They usually take a lot longer, as you have to wait for each
                individual charcater to come to your table.</dd>
